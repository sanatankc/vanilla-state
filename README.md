# Vanilla state

> State management like React with vanilla JS

## what it does?

It lets you to manage your app in states without the heavy setup of React and it's friends. It's great if you just want to think is states but the goal is not big that you want to add react and its friends in your tool chain then `Vanilla state` is made perfect for just that task.     

## Where you can Use?
you can use it in your small [Codepen's](https://codepen.io) pen or your dream website alike.
But if you ask me to be specific about what separates this library from the rest is that _if you don't like to install  1000 packages before writing your first line of code then this is for you_.

## Examples
The core library is just of few simple methods:

see [Example.html](examples/example.html) and [Example.js](examples/example.js) 

## Contribution
We are working on the API, so there is no `contribute.md` for now, but if you want to contribute then just open a PR or issue with your proposal.
